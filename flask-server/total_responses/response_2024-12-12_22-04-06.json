    "prompt": "Summarize this article. Ensure you are clear, concise, and to the point. If you believe there may be a word that some people may not know, please explain it. The point of summarization is for people to have quick reads and quick information: Pornhub is back with its latest year in review. Considering the threats to the adult industry with Project 2025, these insights seem more pertinent than ever. Here are all the biggest trends \u2014 political and otherwise \u2014 that the tube site observed this year.This is the first of these reviews after the 2024 U.S. election, which divided the entire nation \u2014 including the porn industry. While some performers support Donald Trump, many fear the outcome of his presidency. This is due to Project 2025, a wishlist for Trump to implement in his second term \u2014 including a porn ban.Whether such a ban will occur remains to be seen. Several U.S. states have already imposed age-verification laws, requiring ID for websites where over a third of the content hosted is explicit, thus making porn harder to access. Pornhub has responded by blocking itself from these states including Texas, Indiana, and Kentucky. Because of this, the map of the most popular searches in each state looks a bit different this year. The states where Pornhub is banned are grayed out:Despite the efforts to ban porn (or at least limit access), the U.S. dominated the list of top 20 countries by traffic. (USA, USA!) The nation does have a higher population than the others in the top spots \u2014 but the sheer amount of traffic it drives to Pornhub is notable:These top 20 countries account for 79.2 percent of all daily traffic, according to Pornhub. By time spent on the site, Mexico and the Netherlands beat out the U.S. slightly:Geopolitics aside, Pornhub notes that the average time spent overall has dropped 29 seconds this year. Young adults are driving this increase: 18-24-year-olds spent less than 76 seconds on the site compared to the average. Either they're getting their kicks too soon, or going elsewhere.Not only are women watching porn, but they're spending 17 seconds longer on Pornhub compared to male visitors overall. Women account for 38 percent of Pornhub viewers worldwide, up slightly from last year (36 percent).As last year, more women in the Philippines viewed Pornhub than men. In the U.S., 29 percent of Pornhub viewers are women. This has remained consistent in recent Pornhub year in reviews. Women are much more likely to view videos featuring scissoring, cunnilingus, and solo men \u2014 also consistent with years past.In 2023, Mashable pointed out that boomers are into trans porn. What about this year?Boomers were 36 percent more likely than younger generations to view strap-on porn this year, and 32 percent more likely to view gangbangs. Trans porn didn't make the cut.Gen Z, meanwhile, was much more likely (+392 percent) to view vertical videos than older folks. Finally, here are the top trends Pornhub identified this year:Being \"demure\" and \"modest\": Very mindful, very cutesy! Searches for \"demure\" increased 133 percent this year, and \"mindful pleasure\" rose 112 percent.Tradwives: The reality show The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives and the increase of tradwife content on TikTok has ushered in an interest in wifey videos. The search term \"traditional wife\" increased by 34 percent, and \"tradwife\" was up 72 percent. Interest in Mormon content specifically had a big increase this year: \"Mormon sex\" searches grew 92 percent, \"Mormon wife\" 71 percent, and \"Mormon threesome\" 122 percent.Coworker fantasies: The Cut declared 2024 the year of the office pervert, and if Pornhub searches are any indication, that's true. Searches for \"coworker\" increased 92 percent, and \"workplace fantasy\" 57 percent. Viewers were particularly interested in infidelity fantasies: \"office affair\" was up 25 percent and \"cheating coworker\" 71 percent.Getting your head in the game: The 2024 Paris Olympics inspired searches like \"sex olympics,\" \"nude olympics,\" and simply \"athlete.\" Plus, France had the #2 spot in Pornhub traffic this year \u2014 maybe from all the visitors?Hentai and anime: The popularity of animated porn isn't new, but it did continue to grow this year. \"Realistic animated\" searches grew 78 percent.Hawk tuah on that thing: The phrase \"hawk tuah\" resulted in 10 million searches on Pornhub, and searches for \"spit on dick\" increased 233 percent. Hailey Welch inspired a movement...until Hawk Tuah Coin, that is.To view all the tube site's insights, check out Pornhub's 2024 Year in Review.\nTopics\nPorn\nPornhub\nAnna Iovine is associate editor of features at Mashable.

    "response": "Pornhub's latest year in review highlights significant trends in the adult industry, particularly in light of political developments like Project 2025, which could potentially include a porn ban if Donald Trump were reelected. Despite age-verification laws in several U.S. states limiting access, the U.S. still leads globally in traffic to the site. Viewing habits indicate a drop in average time spent on Pornhub, with young adults (18-24) visiting for shorter periods. Women now make up 38% of viewers and, notably, spend more time on the site than men.\n\nRegional interests diverge, with U.S. boomer viewers showing increased interest in specific categories like strap-on. Gen Z has a growing preference for vertical video content. Key trends include rising searches for terms like \"demure,\" \"tradwife,\" and \"coworker fantasies,\" influenced by societal shifts and cultural references.\n\nThe analysis also notes an ongoing fascination with hentai and animated content, alongside peculiar trends like the \"hawk tuah\" phenomenon. For a detailed exploration of these insights, one can refer to Pornhub's 2024 Year in Review.",
